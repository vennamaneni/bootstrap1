Responsive web page using bootsrap

Responsive wen design: "Responsive‚Äù in the context of websites is that it should be compatible with all kinds and sizes of devices
by using <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> We are setting the width of the page to the width of the device and initially scaling it to 1, i.e. default size.

I have divided the above responsive webpage into different categories and we will see how to build each one of them in detail.

The Responsive Navigation Marketing Area Contents Section Right side bar Footer

I developed a responsive web page Without writing a single piece of CSS by using bootstrap.
